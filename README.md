Super Smash Brothers Ultimate Data Website


# Description
The intent of this project was to create an interactive and visually pleasing website in `R` using the `shiny` package, with the data deriving from a popular franchise - Super Smash Brothers. 

More specifically, all of the numbers present are based on the most recent game from the franchise - *Super Smash Brothers Ultimate*

The first tab of the website is focused on a *general overview* of *key statistics*, followed by other tabs relating to more in depth analyses of specific technical data.

The purpose of each tab is to give its reader a better idea of what character is best to play as based on their own fighting style and or preferences.
